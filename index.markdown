# dsdev - Wendelin's Blog

Hi, I'm Wendelin!

As a Cloud Solution Architect specializing in C# and modern Microsoft technologies, I design scalable and maintainable solutions in the cloud. I'm passionate about domain-driven design, using it to model complex business processes and create sustainable software architectures.

I'm passionate about platform engineering and DevOps, and I love to share my knowledge with the community. I believe in the power of open source and collaboration, and I'm always looking for new ways to contribute and learn from others.
