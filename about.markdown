## Professional Background

I'm a passionate Cloud Solution Architect with expertise in Microsoft Azure, .NET development, and domain-driven design. With over a decade of experience in the software industry, I specialize in designing and implementing scalable cloud architectures that solve complex business challenges.

My technical expertise includes:

- **Cloud Technologies**: Microsoft Azure, Azure Functions, App Services, Azure DevOps
- **Languages & Frameworks**: C#, .NET, ASP.NET Core, Blazor
- **Architecture Patterns**: Domain-Driven Design, Microservices, Event-Driven Architecture
- **DevOps & Infrastructure**: CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code, Docker, Kubernetes
- **APIs & Integration**: RESTful APIs, Spotify API, Graph API

## Professional Philosophy

I believe that good software architecture starts with a deep understanding of the business domain. By applying domain-driven design principles, I create solutions that not only meet technical requirements but also accurately reflect and support business processes.

In my development approach, I prioritize:

- **Clean Code**: Maintainable, readable, and well-tested code
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designing for future growth and performance
- **User-Centric Design**: Focusing on the end-user experience
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Contributing to the developer community

## Beyond Coding

When I'm not working on cloud solutions, I'm passionate about music and enjoy exploring new artists and genres through Spotify. I also contribute to open-source projects and occasionally speak at tech conferences and meetups on topics related to cloud architecture and .NET development.
